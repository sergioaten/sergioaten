Hey!👋

👩‍💻 My name is Sergio, and I'm passionate about the world of IT, with solid experience as a systems administrator and support technician. Throughout my professional career, I have gained valuable skills in managing traditional infrastructures.

☁️ In the past two years, I have redirected my professional career towards cloud environments, such as Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. During an exciting project with Terraform, I realized that I want to focus my future career in the field of DevOps or similar roles.

📜 In the past few months, I have also been learning automation with bash and Python.

⚙️ My goal is to specialize in DevOps and work with tools and technologies like:
- Terraform for infrastructure as code.
- Docker and Kubernetes for containerization.
- CI/CD (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.).
- Git for version control.
- Scripting with bash and Python.

🦾 I am proactive, a fast learner, and I like to stay up to date with the latest trends and best practices. I enjoy working in teams, where I can contribute my perspective, and I'm always ready to help.

🔍 If you are looking for someone with strong technical skills, a results-oriented mindset, and a passionate approach to the successful implementation of DevOps, feel free to connect with me. I am open to new opportunities, challenging projects, and roles that allow me to continue growing and developing in this exciting field.
